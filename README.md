## Usage

After installing dependencies, start the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the Electron app with React for local testing and development.

## Building the Application

To create a production build for your operating system, use one of the following commands:

- **Windows:**
    ```bash
    npm run build:win
    ```
- **macOS:**
    ```bash
    npm run build:mac
    ```
- **Linux:**
    ```bash
    npm run build:linux
    ```

The build output will be located in the `dist` directory. You can distribute the generated executable to run the app on your target platform.
